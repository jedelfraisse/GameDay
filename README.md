  "OBS": {
    "WebSocketUrl": "ws://localhost:4455",
    "WebSocketPassword": "your-obs-password"
  },
  "SignalR": {
    "MaxConnectionsPerUser": 5
  }
}
```

### OBS Studio Setup (Optional)

# Unit tests
dotnet test tests/GameDay.Core.Tests/

# Integration tests (uses Aspire test containers)
dotnet test tests/GameDay.Integration.Tests/
```

### Plugin Development

Create custom plugins by implementing `IGameDayPlugin`:

```csharp
public class CustomTriviaPlugin : IGameDayPlugin
{
    public string Name => "Custom Trivia Pack";
    public string Version => "1.0.0";
    
    public void Initialize(IServiceCollection services)
    {
        // Register your services
    }
}
```
